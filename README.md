## Inspiration
The increasing burden on healthcare systems worldwide and the need for quicker and more efficient diagnosis led us to create AI Doctor Assistant. my goal is to provide doctors with a tool that can aid in the diagnosis process and help them make informed decisions faster.

## What it does
AI Doctor Assistant is a medical AI tool that can predict various diseases like breast cancer, healthy/unhealthy heart, lung and diabetes. It also includes a chatbot that functions as a virtual assistant to ansIr any queries a doctor might have. The AI model is trained on relevant medical data and uses state-of-the-art algorithms to make predictions.

## How I built it
I started by gathering a diverse dataset of medical records and thoroughly pre-processing the data to ensure its quality. I then trained a machine learning model using a suitable algorithm and fine-tuned it to increase its accuracy. Finally, I integrated the AI model with a chatbot interface to make the tool more user-friendly and accessible for doctors.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was the lack of large and diverse datasets. To overcome this, we had to use techniques like data augmentation and feature engineering to make the most of the available data. Additionally, integrating the AI model with a chatbot was a complex task that required a lot of effort to ensure a smooth and seamless user experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have created a tool that has the potential to make a positive impact in the medical field. The accuracy of my AI model and its ability to predict diseases with high precision is something we are particularly proud of. Additionally, the user-friendly interface of the chatbot and its ability to quickly provide relevant information makes my tool unique and valuable.

## What I learned
During the development of AI Doctor Assistant, we gained a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in the medical field and the importance of high-quality data. We also learned the value of effective collaboration and effort in building complex projects like this.

## What's next for Ai-o-Doc Assist
My goal is to continue improving AI Doctor Assistant and making it more accurate and accessible for doctors worldwide. We plan on expanding my database and exploring new algorithms that can further increase the tool's accuracy. Additionally, I will be working on integrating the tool with electronic health records systems to make it even more useful for doctors in their daily work.
